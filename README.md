LinkedIn Profile QR Code Generator

Description:
The "LinkedIn Profile QR Code Generator" is a Python script designed to generate QR codes for LinkedIn profiles. It utilizes the `qrcode` library in Python 
to create QR codes from a given LinkedIn profile URL. The purpose of this project is to provide an easy way for users to share their LinkedIn profiles
in various contexts, such as business cards, resumes, presentations, or online portfolios.

The script takes a LinkedIn profile URL as input and generates a QR code image representing that URL. Users can then save the generated QR code 
image to their local system for further use. This project simplifies the process of sharing LinkedIn profiles by eliminating the need for manually typing
or copying long URLs, making it convenient for both the profile owner and those who want to access the profile.

Key Features:
1. Input: Accepts a LinkedIn profile URL as input.
2. QR Code Generation: Utilizes the `qrcode` library to generate a QR code image from the input URL.
3. Output: Saves the generated QR code image to the local system with a customizable file name.
4. Accessibility: Provides an efficient way for users to share their LinkedIn profiles in both digital and physical formats.
5. Convenience: Streamlines the process of sharing LinkedIn profiles by eliminating the need for manual URL sharing.

Usage:
Users can run the script and provide their LinkedIn profile URL as input. The script then generates a QR code representing the profile 
URL, which users can save and share as needed.

This project serves as a practical tool for professionals who frequently share their LinkedIn profiles, enhancing their networking and 
professional branding efforts.
